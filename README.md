# PowerShell-Here

## Synopsis

This script helps to open the PowerShell from any folder or explorer
window. The right click menu displays the option "PowerShell Here"

## Installation

.\PowerShell-Here

## Motivation

It really bugged me that I had to open PowerShell and change directory to the
intended location. I used to open the shell with the ALT+D key combination and
typed PowerShell, but this seemed more elegant.

## Installation

Clone the project. Go to the directory and run the PowerShell-Here.ps1 file.
